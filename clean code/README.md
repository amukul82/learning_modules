### Clean Code
#### By Robert C. Martin

* Specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute then is <i>programming</i>. Such a specification is <i>code</i>.

* The only way to make the deadline, the only way to go fast, is to keep the code as clean as possible at times.

* Clean code is <i>focused</i>. Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.

* It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that makes the language appear simple.

* The Boy Scout Rule - <i>Leave the campground cleaner than you found it</i>.
